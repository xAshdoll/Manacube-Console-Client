# Set-up
Download the actual client from the website I listed in the description.
Download the files (except this README.md file of course) and place the files and the client in the same folder (you can name it whatever you want).
Open relog.txt, accounts.txt, afk.bat and check.txt with a text editor (e.g. notepad) and fill in the needed information (* beside fields which require filling up).
Email refers to the email your MC account is binded to. Password refers to the password of your MC account. /server specify refers to the server you would like to afk on. For example, if I choose to afk on aztec, I would set it to /server aztec.
To go AFK, click on afk.bat.
To close it, just close the program or type /quit into the command prompt.
# What it does
For now, I only configured the most basic of features.
It will connect you to Manacube, select your chosen server and type /afk.
It will relog you if you disconnect. It does so by checking if you receive any of the messages in kickmessages.txt. If you encounter some other message, just update the txt file.
# Questions
Is this a virus? No. If you do not trust the files, just open them with a text editor and you will see that it is just plain text.
Will I update it? Probably. I'm just super busy right now.
Can you automine / autokill mobs with this client. Sure you could, but as this is a bannable offense, I have not included any scripts which accomplish this. I strongly discourage you from botting as this might get you banned.
Any other questions or requests could be sent to me via Github or in Minecraft (IGN: Ashdoll_ I play the aztec skyblock server, if I don't respond, I'm probably afk).
